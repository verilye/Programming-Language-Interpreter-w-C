## TODO:

Write a parser in the style of my previous projects
Read in tokens -> define them in the style that the VM compiler demands

Have grammar predefined in files as an interpreter
e.g type expression symbol expression = assignment pattern '

Implement the virtual machine
Will require picking up some new knowledge and synthesising it with existing knowledge
